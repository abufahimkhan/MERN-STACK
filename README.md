Let's break down the code and understand how each part works:

server.js
Dependencies and Setup:

express, mongoose, and cors are imported.
An instance of express is created, and a model (Contact) is imported from the ContactModel.js file.
Middleware:

cors middleware is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing your React app (running on a different port) to make requests to the server.
Database Connection:

MongoDB is connected using Mongoose. The connection string is 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/Phonebook'.
Routes:

app.get('/getData', ...): Fetches data from the MongoDB using the Contact model and sends it as a JSON response.
app.post('/saveContact', ...): Saves a new contact to the MongoDB using the Contact model.
Server Listening:

The server listens on port 3001, and a message is logged when the server is running.
Contact Model:

A Mongoose schema (schemaModel) is defined with fields for first name, last name, and phone.
A Mongoose model (Contact) is created using the schema and exported.
ContactModel.js
Contact Model:

The Mongoose model (Contact) is created based on the schema defined in server.js.
Export:

The Contact model is exported to be used in other files.
Phonebook.js (React component)
State:

The component uses the state to manage the list of contacts (entries) and individual form input values (firstname, lastname, phone).
Effect Hook:

The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the server when the component mounts.
Axios Requests:

Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the server.
axios.get('http://localhost:3001/getData'): Fetches data from the server and updates the entries state.
axios.post('http://localhost:3001/saveContact', { ... }): Sends a new contact to be saved on the server.
Form Submission:

When the form is submitted, the handleSubmit function is called.
It validates input fields, sends a request to save the contact, and then fetches updated data from the server.
Rendering:

The component renders a form to add contacts and a table to display the contact list.
Port Usage:
The React app and the server can run on different ports. 
In your case, React is running on port 5173, and the server is running on port 3001. This is perfectly fine, and it's a common practice to use different ports for client and server applications.
The ports should not conflict as they serve different purposes. Ensure that your React app is configured to make requests to the correct server port (in this case, 3001).
Cross-origin requests are allowed due to the use of the cors middleware on the server.
